Improve the Bookmarklet, particularly the 'Case Notes Checker'
- Before the Generate button, there should be Cancel button.
- Remove the vertical scrollbar for both Input Data and Analysis Result.
- Currently, with the smaller monitor, the bottom part of the Subject Line and Case Notes cannot be seen, I mean, the size of the card prevents them to see the bottom part of this partuclar section, so I just want them to be layed out.
- The scrollbar should be for the whole window instead of for each card.
- The result of 'Case Notes Checker' is based on the Transcript and the Case Notes Prompt Settings. And this works properly.
- I just want to improve the output of the generated AI, make sure that it should be generated all at once, preventing multiple requests.
- Pleae also give me the recommended prompt for the 'Case Notes Prompt Settings' in a file that I can just copy-paste so that it would give me the desired result.
- The output I prefer is below:

SUMMARY
The summary of the transcript here. You should use the 'Issue/Concern Prompt Settings'. Upon generation of this summary, the 'Issue/Concern' of the QA Form Tool should also be populated by this summary so that I don't need to rerun the AI for the separate Issue/Concern.
